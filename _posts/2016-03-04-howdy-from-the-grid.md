# Howdy From The Grid!

Finally got in, yay! Let's see what this bad boy can (and can't) do...

Ok that's a cool pic. No biggie.

Here's a short paragraph of me blabbing on an on about the editor. It was not intuitive at all for me as all the controls are hidden away until you actually need them. It all makes sense once you select some text (the options show up and hover over the selection so you can **make bold text**, _or italics_, [or make a link][0] to your own website for no good reason, or whatever else.

Things I'm impressed about:

* No hassle with credentials. You just use your Twitter, FB, Google or Github account.
* Nothing major to configure, you just start typing
* Let's see what else. Umm don't know. I've been here for 5min.

Let's add a photo credit to the end by copy and pasting. Done.

See you in the next post. Stay strong out there.

That was a stupid thing to say. It's 2016\.

So was that. I'm out.
