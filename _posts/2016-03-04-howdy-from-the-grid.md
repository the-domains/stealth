# That's one cool grid...
![It's a pretty cool pic of a grid.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/683eba8309898bd894e61fcbba52940b1a7fcf46.jpg)

Finally got in, yay! Only had to wait a year but anyway. That much was clear from the get go. Let's see what this bad boy can (and can't) do...
![It's the Gutenberg bible. What's not to like?](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e96452b8c126a5e13d9ee25884772697fc81afc7.jpg)

Ok that's a cool pic of the Gutenberg bible. No biggie. So why did I choose that pic? No reason.

Here's a short paragraph of me blabbing on an on about the editor. It was not intuitive at all for me as all the controls are hidden away until you actually need them. It all makes sense once you select some text (the options show up and hover over the selection so you can **make bold text**, _or italics_, [or make a link][0] to your own website for no good reason, or whatever else. You can also use the standard shortcuts like cmd+B, cmd+I, and so on. Yeah, I'm on mac. Big deal.

Things I'm impressed about:

* No hassle with credentials. You just use your Twitter, FB, Google or Github account.
* Nothing major to configure, you just start typing. Refreshing after setting up Wordpress for the gazillionth time.
* Let's see what else. Umm don't know. I've been here for 5min.

Let's add a photo credit to the end by copy and pasting. Done.

See you in the next post. Stay strong out there.

That was a stupid thing to say. It's 2016\.

So was that. I'm out.
