# The Grid Review - part 1 of 3

Welcome to the Definitive Grid State of The Union! I'm the Founding Member \#26758 and in this lengthy series of posts I'll be exploring what The (current) Grid can and can't do. This is the first post in the series and the first post I've ever published with [The Grid][0]. 

As The Grid updates, so will this series. Feel free to point out any mistakes and I'll update the posts.

Main takeaway of the series: what can you expect from The Grid **right now**.

Just to be clear: I have no affiliation with The Grid other than becoming a Founding Member. I did have several moments of second-guessing my decision but looks like I finally got in. I will try to be as objective as I can.

I haven't really been reading the email updates they've been sending to their mailing list nor have I seen any sites made with The Grid. I did notice a growing number of complaints in their sponsored posts and FB page:

> So this thing was basically a scam then? We just funded a few open-plan office dwelling, swiss-ball jockeys to dick around with HTML and Photoshop for 18 months?Posted by [Myles Scott][1] on [Friday, February 19, 2016][2]

> When do I get access to this? Feels like i threw money into the trash on this.Posted by [Jeff Vance][3] on [Monday, February 15, 2016][4]

It goes on and on.

People are not very patient after they've decided to dig their pockets for their hard-earned cash. Even if it should be clear from the get-go that this is not a sure thing. But crowdfunding could be an entire series on its own.

Moving on. Here's the breakdown of the posts:

Part 1 (this post) will focus on the initial, overall experience from the moment I got the "You're in!" email to publishing my first post (the one you're reading right now). 

Part 2 will focus on the Design/Visual editor, drafting posts, publishing them and whether or not it's possible to get something decent out of it without spending hours on it. _Disclaimer: I'm not a designer._

Part 3 will be dedicated to the quirks and bugs I encountered while writing this series. The title will be along the lines of "Why The Grid is and should still be in Beta."

**The overall experience. Go.**

Finally got in, yay! 

My wait lasted about 51 weeks from the moment I became a Founding Member. I knew I had to wait a while but I definitely expected to get in sooner. From the "You're in!" email:

> We're giving access in order of Founding Member number and our current pace is 200 new users a day. We're planning to increase the size of the daily waves as we continue to make improvements and updates.

With about 200 new users every day, it won't be long now. Be patient a little longer.

See you in the next post! I'll be looking at the post editor, drafts, publishing, the visual editor and all the every-day things.
