# The Grid Review - part 2/3

Welcome to The Definitive Grid State of The Union! This is the part 2 of the series. In case you missed it, here's the part 1 & part 3\.

As I'm typing this I'm also typing my first support request. It seems The Grid still has some kinks that need fixing. Whatever you type as the site title when you first create the site will be there forever.

UPDATE: the site title went live after waiting an hour or so.

Let's add another cool photo.

I wish I was there. Instead, I'm here struggling with some **pretty basic stuff.**

Onwards.

## Creating my first site

When you first create a site, You'll get to add a name for your site, the tagline/description, and a Google Analytics ID for tracking. You can change the url too, but let's have a look at that later. That's it. Nothing else to configure for now. It's time to create the first post.

Aaand it looks like drag'drop doesn't work yet. Let's use the button.

Here's me editing the very first post of this series. Pretty cool. You can even reorder stuff. After you publish, The Grid needs some time to think how to display your post. It lets you know after a while and then you get this:

Umm ok. Crappy fonts. All the pictures have filters, and it looks kind of crappy. I mean look at this weird little rectangle it decided to put on top of my Gutenberg bible picture!

Just weird. Why?

Because I didn't tell The Grid what I really want the site to look like. Let's do that next.

Back in the dashboard there's a tab called design. Let's go there.

BOOM! Images didn't finish uploading, lost some text.

And we're back. Just lost a couple of paragraphs after images stopped uploading. Let's type all of that again :-)

As I was saying before the editor crashed you can add a color palette by uploading a picture and then adjusting colors and the overall feel by pulling sliders with weirdish names on them. 

"Rhytmic contrast?" What's that? Let's try it. Nothing happens.

Ok brand strength. Colors changed a little. Lightness, yes definitely want lightness. Saturation hmmm I guess neutral?

There's very little choice in addition to these sliders. Hope you can find a satisfying combination.

Onwards!

Next you get Layout.

BOOM! Lost some pics and text again. Looks like it's better to use some alternative ways of adding content. The web app seems to hang quite a bit while uploading photos.

UPDATE: I installed The Grid app on my iPhone but it looks like you can't yet add any content. So currently the recommended way is to write in any text editor you would normally use and copy&paste the finished post to the Editor.

UPDATE 2: When you copy&paste text, you lose some of the formatting. So type the raw text somewhere else, and then do the final formatting in The Grid.

## The Editor

Writing, formatting, adding photos and captions, saving, etc.

**The controls**

Editing content was not intuitive at all for me as all the controls are hidden away until you actually need them. It all makes sense once you select some text (the options show up and hover over the selection so you can make **bold text**,_or italics_,[or make a link][0] to your own website for no good reason, or whatever else. You can also use the standard shortcuts like cmd+B, cmd+I (Mac), or ctrl+B, ctrl+I if you're on Windows.

**The Editor overview**

Things I like:

* No hassle with credentials. You just use your Twitter, FB, Google or Github account.
* Nothing major to configure, you just start typing. Refreshing after setting up Wordpress for the gazillionth time.
* Let's see what else. Umm don't know. I've been here for 5min.

Things I don't like:

* Can't underline or strikethrough :(

I guess this post is done. See you in post \#3\.
