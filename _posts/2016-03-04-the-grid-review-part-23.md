# The Grid review - part 2/3

As I'm typing this I'm also typing my first support request. It seems The Grid still has some kinks that need fixing. Whatever you type as the site title when you first create the site will be there forever. Even if you try to change it. I'm sure this is fixed at some point. But if you happen to typo or just change your mind it's kind of annoying. Just saying.

In this post I'll have a look at the first impressions from creating my very first site with The Grid. There'll be plenty of screenshots and explanation. Hooray.

Let's add another cool photo.

I wish I was there. Instead, I'm here struggling with some **pretty basic stuff.**

Onwards.

## Creating my first site

When you first create a site, You'll get to add a name for your site, the tagline/description, and a Google Analytics ID for tracking. You can change the url too, but let's have a look at that later. That's it. Nothing else to configure for now. It's time to create the first post.

Aaand it looks like drag'drop doesn't work yet. Let's use the button.

Here's me editing the very first post of this series. Pretty cool. You can even reorder stuff. After you publish, The Grid needs some time to think how to display your post. It lets you know after a while and then you get this:

Umm ok. Crappy fonts. All the pictures have filters, and it looks kind of crappy. I mean look at this weird little rectangle it decided to put on top of my Gutenberg bible picture!

Just weird. Why?

Because I didn't tell The Grid what I really want the site to look like. Let's do that next.

Back in the dashboard there's a tab called design. Let's go there.

And we're back. Just lost a couple of paragraphs after images stopped uploading. Let's type them again!

As I was saying (which you wouldn't know unless I tell you) you can add a color palette by uploading a picture and then adjusting colors and the overall feel by pulling sliders with weirdish names on them. 

"Rhytmic contrast?" What's that? Let's try it. Nothing happens.

Ok brand strength. Colors changed a little. Lightness, yes definitely want lightness. Saturation hmmm I guess neutral?

Onwards!

Next you get Layout.
