# The Grid Review - part 3/3

Welcome to the third and final part of the Definitive Grid State of The Union series. In this series I'm exploring The Grid and what it can and can't do. Here's part 1 & part 2 in case you missed them.

## Summary

Pros:

* Simple to just start adding content
* Kind of nice to just pull some sliders and a "look" is given
* Easy to setup sites and point domains
* Login is a breeze with FB/Twitter/etc accounts

Cons:

* It's. So. Damn. Slow. Not just publishing a post or updating the design with the sliders.. Everything takes time. Even photos take forever to load for the visitors. And when it says it's done updating the site. It's not. Changes come up an hour, a day later, sometimes never. Makes me want to just give up and cry.
* Boom. Crash. That happens a lot. Images never upload. Saving the post didn't actually save the post so I ended up rewriting a lot of the content.

**The bottom line**: it's not yet ready. If it took more than a year to get it to this point, why should I wait even longer to get something usable. At the moment super-human patience is required but who knows what they can do in another year or so. 

Stay tuned, I'll be updating these posts as The Grid moves towards an eventual launch.

Thanks for reading this far. Here's part 1 & part 2 in case you missed them.
